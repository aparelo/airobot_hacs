# Airobot thermostat Integration for Home Assistant

This integration adds support for [Airobot smart thermostats](https://airobothome.com/en/smart-thermostat/) to Home Assistant. It has currently only been tested with the standalone 230V thermostat. It should also work with the room controller, but that has not been validated.
